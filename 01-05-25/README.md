# INLIGHTS---SMART-TRAFFIC-CONTROL-SYSTEM
INLIGHTS is a multithreaded traffic control system for managing signal flow at intersections using real-time simulations. Built in C on Linux, the project showcases OS-level concepts like system calls, thread generation, synchronization (Producer-Consumer), and pipelining to optimize vehicle movement and reduce congestion.
